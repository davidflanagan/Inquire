# Inquire
A browser-based programming environment for inquisitive programming

This is a prototype (and trivial and incomplete) programming
environment for computational inquiry. It is intended to demonstrate a
new way of teaching programming in schools by integrating simple
coding into math and science classes.

Please read

to understand what I mean by the terms _inquisitive programming_ and
_computational inquiry_.

Once you understand what the point is, you can try this out by loading
`inquire.html` into your browser (only tested with Firefox, so
far). Enter markdown on the left, and click the **Run** button to
display it on the right. The difference from a regular markdown parser
is that code you enter on the left is both displayed and executed on
the right, and that code can display its output in the generated
document.

Right now, this is so incomplete that it doesn't have any way to save
or load programs. Try pasting the text from the files in the
`examples/` directory into the left-hand box to see complet inquires.
